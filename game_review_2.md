I rate game from 1 to 5 stars and I rate this game 4 out of 5 stars.

## Summary
This game is about a group of criminals named Hoxton, Dallas, Wolf and Chains. This group goes around doing jobs such as robbing,
selling drugs and breaking out inmates. This game is a first-person shooter, the player has the option to choose who they want
to play as either, Hoxton, Dallas, Wolf and Chains. There are other characters to choose from however they are from a DLC pack.
After the play has chosen their character they must now choose two guns, one Melee weapon, body armor, and equipment(turrets, trip mines,
or ammo bag etc). 

The player will also need to choose a throwable weapon which consists of a varity of grenades such as flash bangs, stun, and molotov.
Now its time for the player to choose their skill they have the option to choose between Mastermind, Enforcer, Technician, Ghost
and Fugitive. The skills are basically bonuses to help the player throughout the game, the important thing that the player 
worry about is the perks which are crew cheif, muscle, armorer, rogue, etc. these perks benefit the player during the game by
getting more drugs, carry more items and break into the facilites faster. 

The player has the option to choose jobs which can either be making drugs, stealing, or breaking out inmates. each job has a rank
either easy, medium, hard, or extremely hard. the more difficult the job is then more the player will get paid. The player had the option 
to choose to either play AIs or play with other people the limit is 4 players.  when a player chooses a job they will be spawned in whatever 
the job is, so it can be a bank, mall, or a drug house. the player/players may stratgize how to go about this Each time a job is 
completed successfully the player will get paid and level up. When the player levels up they can earn new masks or new weapons, 
they can also earn skill points to upgrade their perks. 

## Final Thoughts
I like PAYDAY 2 game mechanics and character designs, I love the multiple missions I am able to do and Im always up for a challenge 
when it comes to the difficulty. the one thing i did not like about this game would be that it can be every buggy, sometimes the AIs will 
not work properly when they are asked to do something. I think this game is better when played with 4 people.
